Objective:
In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), how do angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) compare for reducing hospitalizations and improving survival?

Methods
Design: Randomized controlled trial (Heart Failure Treatment Study). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00711032.

Allocation: Concealed.

Blinding: Double-blinded (patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors).

Follow-up period: Up to 5 years.

Setting: Multicenter study.

Patients: 1,200 patients (mean age 63 years, 68% men) with symptomatic CHF (New York Heart Association class II-IV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%. Exclusion criteria included intolerance or contraindications to ACEIs or ARBs.

Intervention: ARBs (n = 600) or ACEIs (n = 600). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either an ARB (losartan) or an ACEI (enalapril).

Outcomes: Hospitalization due to worsening CHF, all-cause mortality, change in LVEF, and incidence of renal impairment.

Patient follow-up: 97% (minimum follow-up until death or 4.8 years).

Main results

Hospitalization due to worsening CHF was lower with ARBs than with ACEIs (20% vs 28%, relative risk reduction 29%, 95% CI 15 to 40; number needed to treat 11, CI 7 to 20). Other main results are shown in the Table.

ARBs (losartan) vs ACEIs (enalapril) in patients with congestive heart failure

Outcomes | ARBs | ACEIs | P value |
————————————————————————————————————
All-cause mortality | 35% | 37% | .40 |
Change in LVEF* | +4.2% | +3.8% | .31 |
Incidence of renal impairment† | 12% | 18% | .02 |
————————————————————————————————————
*LVEF: left ventricular ejection fraction.
†Defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or ≥ 50% from baseline.
————————————————————————————————————

Conclusion
In patients with congestive heart failure, angiotensin receptor blockers were more effective than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing hospitalizations due to worsening CHF and the incidence of renal impairment, with no significant difference in all-cause mortality or change in LVEF.

Sources of funding: National Institutes of Health and Cardiovascular Research Foundation.

Objective:
In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices, how do endoscopic sclerotherapy and emergency portacaval shunt
compare for control of bleeding and survival?

Methods
Design: Randomized controlled trial (San Diego Bleeding Esophageal Varices Study). ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00690027.

Allocation: Concealed.

Blinding: Blinded (gastroenterologist who evaluated patients for portal-systemic encephalopathy).

Follow-up period: Up to 17 years.

Setting: University of California San Diego Medical Center.

Patients: 211 patients (mean age 49 years, 77% men) with acute bleeding esophageal varices resulting from cirrhosis, who required a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of blood and, for patients transferred from other hospitals, observation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding within 48 hours of transfer. Exclusion criterion was > 1 previous session of endoscopic sclerotherapy.

Intervention: Endoscopic sclerotherapy (n = 106) or emergency portacaval shunt (n = 105). Emergency portacaval shunt comprised a direct side-to-side or direct end-to-side portacaval shunt done within 8 hours of initial contact.

Outcomes: Control of bleeding at > 30 days, survival, readmissions for variceal or nonvariceal bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells, and recurrent portal-systemic encephalopathy.

Patient follow-up: 100% (minimum follow-up until death or 9.4 years).

Main results

15-year survival was lower with endoscopic sclerotherapy than with emergency portacaval shunt (10/106 vs 48/105, relative benefit reduction 79%, 95% CI 62 to 89; number needed to harm 3, CI 2 to 4). Other main results are shown in the Table.

Conclusion
In patients with cirrhosis and acute bleeding esophageal varices, emergency portacaval shunt was better than endoscopic sclerotherapy for control of bleeding, recurrent encephalopathy, and survival.

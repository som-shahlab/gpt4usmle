## Overview

**QUEST-AI** is an innovative system designed to generate, verify, and refine USMLE-style exam questions using Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4. This system aims to streamline the development of medical exam content, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative for creating study materials and practice questions for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE).

## Features

1. **Question Generation**: Utilizes GPT-4 to generate USMLE-style questions.
2. **Verification**: An ensemble of LLMs identifies and flags potentially incorrect questions.
3. **Refinement**: GPT-4 refines flagged questions to improve accuracy and validity.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets, including both AI-generated and human-generated questions.
- **manuscript/**: Drafts and related documents for the research paper.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and evaluation.
- **src/**: Source code for the QUEST-AI system.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/som-shahlab/gpt4usmle.git
```

## Usage

To do inference by ensemble of LLMs, run:

```bash
bash inference_single_model.sh
```

To fix or refine incorrect questions generated by GPT-4, run:

```bash
python fix_incorrect_questions.py
```

To categotize questions based on the USMLE content categories, run:

```bash
python classify_questions.py
```
